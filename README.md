## Requirements

Please review the [Requirements](https://rke.docs.rancher.com/os) for each node in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Getting Started

Please refer to our [RKE docs](https://rke.docs.rancher.com/) for information on how to get started!
For cluster config examples, refer to [RKE cluster.yml examples](https://rke.docs.rancher.com/example-yamls)

## Installing Rancher HA using rke

Please use [Setting up a High-availability RKE Kubernetes Cluster](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-cluster-setup/rke1-for-rancher) to install Rancher in a high-availability configuration.

## Building

RKE can be built using the `make` command, and will use the scripts in the `scripts` directory as subcommands. The default subcommand is `ci` and will use `scripts/ci`. Cross compiling can be enabled by setting the environment variable `CROSS=1`. The compiled binaries can be found in the `build/bin` directory. Dependencies are managed by Go modules and can be found in [go.mod](https://github.com/rancher/rke/blob/master/go.mod).

Read [codegen/codegen.go](./codegen/codegen.go) to check the default location for fetching `data.json`. You can override the default location as seen in the example below:

```bash
# Fetch data.json from default location
go generate

# Fetch data.json from URL using RANCHER_METADATA_URL
RANCHER_METADATA_URL=${URL} go generate

# Use data.json from local file
RANCHER_METATDATA_URL=./local/data.json go generate

# Compile RKE
make
```

To override RANCHER_METADATA_URL at runtime, populate the environment variable when running rke CLI. For example:

```bash
RANCHER_METADATA_URL=${URL} rke [commands] [options]

RANCHER_METADATA_URL=${./local/data.json} rke [commands] [options]
```
